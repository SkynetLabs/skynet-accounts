/**
This file contains the defining piece of logic for working with emails. The flow
is as follows:

A sender wants to send a message. In order to do that they use an instance of
`Mailer` to `Send` a message. `Mailer` doesn't actually send the message
but queues it up in the database for future processing. A background thread
running `Sender` is looping over the DB on a timer and taking care to send the
messages waiting there.
*/

type Mailer struct {
	staticDB *database.DB
}

// NewMailer creates a new instance of Mailer.
func NewMailer(db *database.DB) *Mailer {
	return &Mailer{db}

// Send queues an email message for sending. The message will be sent by Sender
// with the next batch of emails.

// SendAccountAccessAttemptedEmail sends a new email to the given email address
// that notifies the user that someone used their email address in an attempt to
// recover a Skynet account but their email is not in our system. The main
// reason to do that is because the user might have forgotten which email they
// used for signing up.
