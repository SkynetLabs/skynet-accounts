# API Guide

## General terms

### ORY, Kratos, Oathkeeper, and JWx

While `skynet-accounts` handles account information in the context of a Skynet portal, the baseline account management (
account CRUD, email verification, password resets, etc.) is handled by [ORY](https://www.ory.sh/)
([Kratos](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/) and [Oathkeeper](https://www.ory.sh/oathkeeper/))
to which we often refer to as "Kratos". This also covers the login/logout process and the issuance of JTW tokens. When
we talk about JWT (or JWK, or JWKS)
we mean the tokens issued by ORY.

The workflow of verification follows a simple pattern:

* Oathkeeper exposes a public link on which it shares the public keys with which anyone can verify the validity of the
  JWT tokens it issues.
* `skynet-accounts` fetches those keys and uses them to validate the JWTs it receives in requests.

### User tiers

The tiers communicated by the API are numeric. This is the mapping:

0. Reserved. It's not used by the API.
1. Free.
2. Premium 5.
3. Premium 20.
4. Premium 80.
